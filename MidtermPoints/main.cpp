// Question 1

// My points: 20/20

// Question 2

// My points: 22/25

// Errors:
// [-1 point] About the precision and fixed position of decimal numbers when print the values, i put those lines inside the loop just before the subtotal result and not before the other values (price and qty); it should be before everything else, maybe even before the loop
// [-2 points] When checking for negative values, I have checked both price and qty in the same IF/ELSE; I should have put separated IF/ELSE for each one. But at least the error message suggests that one of each value is 0 or negative.

// Question 3

// My points: 17/20

// Misspelling error:
// [-1 point] count 1 := 1 -> should be count := 1

// Error:
// [-2 point] should be another if/else to get out of the application if the first value of qty. is negative

// Question 4

// My points: 23/25

// Erros:
// [-2 points] When I type 0 to quit the first qty of the first product, it does not quit... It just happens in the first value, all the others are perfect and quit when typing 0

// Question 5

// My points: 10/10

// Total points = 92/100

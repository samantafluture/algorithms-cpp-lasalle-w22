// Problem 1: Printing Numbers From 1 to 5

// Problem 2: program to find the sum of positive numbers
// if the user enters a negative number, the loop ends
// the negative number entered is not added to the sum

// Problem 3: program to find the sum of positive numbers
// if the user enters a negative numbers, break ends the loop
// the negative number entered is not added to sum

// Problem 4: program to calculate positive numbers till 50 only
// if the user enters a negative number,
// that number is skipped from the calculation
// negative number -> loop terminate
// numbers above 50 -> skip iteration

// Problem 5: Using the template, write a complete C++ program that: 
// 1. outputs the numbers 0 to 200 with the step of 10 if the user choose the option 1(one per line)
// 2. outputs the numbers 0 to 50 with the step of 5 if the user choose the option 2(one per line)
// 3. outputs the numbers 0 to 20 with the step of 1 if the user choose the option 3(two values per line)
// 4. Allow to exit if the user choose the option 4.

// Problem 6: Create the code in C++ by using the loop While to describe an algorithm that:
// - Ask for a number (double) we show a message: Enter a number: and if it is smaller than 0,
// we show a message: Negative number! for 2 times, if the number is bigger than 0, we show
// a message: Positive number! for 3 times, and if the number is equal to 0, we show a
// message: Number = 0! for 5 times.

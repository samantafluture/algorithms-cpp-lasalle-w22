// Problem 1: Printing Numbers From 1 to 5


// Problem 2: C++ program to find the sum of first n natural numbers
// positive integers such as 1,2,3,...n are known as natural numbers


// Problem 3: Using the template, write a complete C++ program that: 
// 1. outputs the numbers 0 to 200 with the step of 10 if the user choose the option 1(one per line)
// 2. outputs the numbers 0 to 50 with the step of 5 if the user choose the option 2(one per line)
// 3. outputs the numbers 0 to 20 with the step of 1 if the user choose the option 3(two values per line)
// 4. Allow to exit if the user choose the option 4.


// Problem 4: Create the code in C++ by using the loop For to describe an algorithm that:
// - Ask for a number (int) we show a message: Enter a number: and if it is smaller than 0, we
// show a message: Smaller than 0! for 5 times, if the number is bigger than 0, we show a
// message: Bigger than 0! for 7 times, and if the number is equal to 0, we show a message:
// Number is 0! for 3 times. 


// Problem 5: Create the code in C++ by using the loop of your choice to describe an algorithm that:
//  Ask for a number (int) by showing a message: Enter a number between 1 and 18: », and then,
// if is true, writes the result of the multiplication of this number with 10, 11, and 12. If the number
// is less than 1 or greater than 18, we'll ask so many times until the user enter a valid number (use
// do – while loop).
// It will bring up this message if the input number is 10:
// The result is : 10 x 10 = 100
// The result is : 10 x 11 = 110
// The result is : 10 x 12 = 120


// Problem 6: Create an application (a .cpp file) using Visual Studio and C++ to describe an algorithm:-which
// requires an integer between 1 and 15, and that calculates the sum of the positive integers up to
// this number. For example, if you enter 5, the program must calculate: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
// NB: you want to show only the result, not the decay of the calculation.
// The result is: = 15
// Then, we'll have a continue message appear: Enter y or Y for continue, or anything else to quit
// and if so, asked to enter another number, if no, two lines below display the message: "Now we
// leave the application!"
// use the following loop structure:
// do{ ... }while((ans =='y')||(ans =='Y')) 


// Problem 7: Create an application (.cpp file) using the Visual Studio tool and the C++ language to describe an
// algorithm that:
// -Asks to enter two numbers "Enter number 1:" and "Enter the number 2:" and which calculates
// the sum, the difference, the product and the result of the division of two numbers. For example,
// if we have 5.1 and 10.3, the program must calculate and display:
// Addition: 5.1 + 10.3 = 15.400
// Subtraction: 5.1-10.3 = - 5.200
// Multiplication: 5.1 * 10.3 = 52.530
// Division: 5.1 / 10.3 = 0.495
// Then, we'll have a continue message appear: Enter y or Y for continue, or anything else to quit
// and if so, asked to enter another number, if no, two lines below display the message: "Now we
// leave the application!"
// use the following magic formula:
// cout.setf(ios::fixed);
// cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
// - cout.precision(3);
